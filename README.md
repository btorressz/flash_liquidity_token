# Flash Liquidity Token (FLT)  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Flash Liquidity Token (FLT) is a Solana-based protocol designed for High-Frequency Trading (HFT) and market-making bots, enabling them to borrow liquidity for ultra-short durations (milliseconds to minutes). The protocol allows users to stake collateral, mint FLT tokens, and access liquidity without long-term capital commitment.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works  

### **Staking**  
- Users stake **SOL, USDC, or other supported SPL tokens** to mint FLT tokens.  

### **Borrowing Liquidity**  
- FLT holders can borrow liquidity from **DEX pools** for ultra-short durations (milliseconds to minutes).  

### **Flash Loan Mechanism**  
- **No Fee** if liquidity is returned within the specified duration.  
- **Interest Fee** applies if liquidity is not returned on time.  

### **Rewards & Fees**  
- A portion of flash loan fees is distributed to stakers.
